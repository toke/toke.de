## Commenting

I'm not a big fan of external services. Especially since I do not log IP-Adresses
and offloading Javascript gives some more problems with privacy.
This site is very simple. But I want to add comments to blog posts. My plan was
to write a little comment script for embedding via Javascript. Since I don't have
so much time right now I will look for alternatives. Now I am experimenting with
[discus](http://discus.com). The service looks nice and integrates very well with
my site. One downside is the missing SSL support. I will look after this later.

For the next weeks the discus service will be available on this site, maybe for
a longer time. We'll see. Feel free to comment.
