# Store a password for use in psql
I was asked today how to use store an password for use with `psql`.
I've done this before several times but could not remember how. So
I tried to look it up with man psql. There was a referer to .pgpass
but no syntax. The pgpass is part of libpq. So this is a reminder
to myself:


## .pgpass format

    hostname:port:database:username:password

To quote the [Documentation][pgpass]: "Each of the first four fields may be a literal value, or \*, which
matches anything."

[pgpass]: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/libpq-pgpass.html
