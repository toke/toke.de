## Deployment

Using an VCS as an deployment tool is not a good practise. Anyway I'm
using GitHub trigger to call an webservice written with the Dancer perl library.
You can read more about this in my [Blogpost](https://toke.de/blog/2012/02/09/how-i-post/).
The code is on GitHub: https://github.com/toke/dancing-github-webhooks
