## Deployment

Using an VCS as an deployment tool is not a good practise. I'm using GitHub
trigger to call an webservice in order to trigger the deployment. I'm using
Dancer perl script to trigger this deployment on pushing to my master branch
on GitHub. You can read more about this on my [Blogpost](https://toke.de/blog/2012/02/09/how-i-post/).
The code is on GitHub: https://github.com/toke/dancing-github-webhooks
