I have a Mebus Weather station from a discounter in my kitchen and an wireless sensor outside the kitchen window.
It operates at 433.92MHz and it's blips and bits are not yet analyzed (at least by me). So lets try to read it.

I will use my crappy rtl2832 DVB Dongle (Rafael Micro R820T) for that. I'd buyed it some time ago for 1€. I'ts a little bit whiny about
everything. Touch it – *määää*. Use it without an Powered HUB *wäääää*. But even that crappy thing is useful ;-)

I have some clue what to expect, so I don't start at zero. I assume the data is modulated as OOK. (On Off Keying)
and I have an progam rtl_443 which can help me decode it.

## Preparation

I have:

 * Linux laptop with USB 2.0 Ports
 * Powered USB 2.0 Hub
 * rtl2832 Dongle connected via powered USB hub up and running
 * rtl-sdr up und running
 * rtl_433 @merbanan  https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433.git compiled
 * kalibrate-rtl https://github.com/asdil12/kalibrate-rtl.git compiled

## Step 1: Getting calibration values for RTL

Let's use GSM 900 Base stations to get the frequency offset.
First get some used GSM-Channels:

`kal -s GSM900`

I'll get:
```
GSM-900:
	chan: 12 (937.4MHz - 32.716kHz)	power: 30360.56
	chan: 45 (944.0MHz - 32.768kHz)	power: 26204.70
	chan: 54 (945.8MHz - 32.858kHz)	power: 163754.18
	chan: 55 (946.0MHz - 32.372kHz)	power: 73929.50
	chan: 64 (947.8MHz - 32.557kHz)	power: 32899.73
	chan: 80 (951.0MHz - 11.769kHz)	power: 27637.33
	chan: 82 (951.4MHz - 32.652kHz)	power: 30945.31
	chan: 86 (952.2MHz - 33.397kHz)	power: 27386.02
```

So channel 54 is the strongest one, let's use it as calibration source.

`kal -c 54`

```
Exact sample rate is: 270833.002142 Hz
kal: Calculating clock frequency offset.
Using GSM-900 channel 54 (945.8MHz)
average		[min, max]	(range, stddev)
- 33.053kHz		[-33070, -33034]	(35, 8.445596)
overruns: 0
not found: 0
average absolute error: 34.947 ppm
```

The **34.947** (35) is my current frequency offset (parts per million).


## Step 2: log some data

We use rtl_433 to log some data and tell rtl_433 the frequency offset we measured above with
the parameter **-p35**.

`rtl_433 -a -p35 -t 2>&1 | tee -a 433.log`

I'll get lots of signals over the time.
Some of them are crap but let's look for my sensor.

After some Seconds:

```
*** signal_start = 7039944, signal_end = 7287168
signal_len = 247224,  pulses = 445
Iteration 1. t: 184    min: 124 (444)    max: 245 (1)    delta 3969
Iteration 2. t: 184    min: 124 (444)    max: 245 (1)    delta 0
Distance coding: Pulse length 184

Short distance: 241, long distance: 485, packet distance: 973

p_limit: 184

```

## Step 3: Starring at Data

OK, wonderful, the display reads 24.5°C 61%. Now dive into the values.
Let's be very naive first. Humidity 61%: 61 = b111101. Just after some
seconds this pattern is identifiable at position 30.

*01100011 00000000 11110101 11110* **011 1101**

Since this is humidity values from 0-99 are likely to appear. So we need 7 Bits and I assume that 7 Bits
are used to encode that data.

Oh my god, that was fast. Lets proof that later.

We are naive, aren't we? So lets look up the other values. Looking backwards we find some more interesting patterns.
There is the bit pattern **11110101** which reads 245 which is 24.5 * 10
HoooHooo. Could this be true?

So we have a hypothesis by one sample.

*01100011 00000000* **11110101** *11110* **011 1101**

Let's try to proof it.

## Step 4: Proof it

We apply a temperature and humidity change to the sensor by just putting it outside.
By doing so we also be blind since we don't see the display (assume we don't have the
base station).

*01100011 00000000* **111100 01** *1111 00* **11 1111**

**241** and **63** Let's look at the display and we find **24.1°C** and **63%**
which is what we expected. Whoot.

The missing pulses could be a preamble and possibly other data like: "low battery indicator",
"°C/°F" bit, and "channel indicator".

## More data

As it turns out the setting "°C/°F" at the sensor only affects the display of the data at the sensor
side. The over the air data seems to be identical, the transmitted data is always °C. Who needs °F anyway?
The first 8 Bit are different after a power cycle so it looks like a dynamic generated ID.

Our dumps above are all done with channel setting 1.

Now repeat this with channel setting 2.

*01100011 00* **01** 0000 *11111101 11110011 1101*

And channel 3.

*01100011 00* **10** 0001 00000010 11110011 1101

Negative values:

-0.8°C:

*01100010 0000* **1111 11110111** *11110100 1011*

## Conclusion

As it turns out this was quite easy. We have the important part of our Protocol:

* 3  Bit Pramble 011
* 5  Bit Address
* 1  Bit Low battery indicator 0 = LOW, 1 = OK
* 1  Bit unknown (always 0?)
* 2  Bit Channel (00,01,10)
* 12 Bit Temperature Signed in °C * 10
* 4  Bit unknown (always 1?)
* 8  Bit Humidity

No CRC but 12 times repetition of data.

Code for reading this sensor data is here: https://github.com/toke/rtl_433/blob/master/src/rtl_433.c#L203 https://github.com/toke/rtl_433

The funny part is from my living room I get a reading if the sensor is in the fridge but
not if it is outside the kitchen window :-(
