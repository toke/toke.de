Just a little fun Project to check out [Processing](https://processing.org/):
Langton's Ant in Processing 3.0


Langton's Ant is interesting, very simple algorithm produces an astonishing
complex, random looking structure but may end in stable state in later cycles.

But after a while it turns into a stable state.
